# Written in Python 3.0
# given an exchange rate and a limit, this program finds the exact money you need to pay to get even amount of dollars (no coin change)
# I hate coin change. If you're like me, then this should be helpful to you

# just change thess variables for any currency and limit you wish
exchange_rate = 3.77
limit = 5000 # keep searching until this limit

for amount1 in range(limit):
	amount2 = amount1 / exchange_rate
	z = round(amount1 % 3.77, 2)

	if (z==3.77):
		print("You can get $", amount2, "when exchanging", amount1, "riyals")
